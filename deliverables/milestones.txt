CSE20312 Final Project


Initial milestones for lab 6 (40pts)
    - Work through SDL tutorials to get sprites on the screen with user control
      (15 pts) *Jeff and Gabe*
    - Develop a prototype for the python script that can take in music files and
      output some sort of text files (15pts) *Matthew D'Alonzo*
    - Develop data structure for storing music from input text files (5pts)
    - Develop basic AI behavior (5pts)

--> If processing music data yields a compileable program within this timeframe, this will be our deliverable. Otherwise, SDL tutorials will be completed to fulfill the requirement.

Overall Development Milestones:

C++ Code
    Graphics
        - Display sprites to window properly using SDL
        - Vary level appearance (possibly randomly)

    Control
        - Capture input from user using SDL
        - Refine controls for smooth gameplay
        - Possibly investigate alternate control schemes (gamepads, touch)

    Gameplay
        - Develop AI Behavior
        - Translate text files into level layouts 
        - Have game objects interact properly (collisions and the like)
        - Develop gameplay variations (alternative powerups, enemy variation, 
          level variation, etc.)

Python Script
    Signal Procesing
        - Translate music file to representative text file to be read by C++
          program *Matthew D'Alonzo*

Other
    - Develop artwork 
    - Study ABC notation or alternative methods of representing music as text
    - Possibly investigate alternate platforms for development (web, mobile)
