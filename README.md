# overtone

### Welcome!

This is a project for our CSE 20312- Data Structures class at the University of Notre Dame.

##### Progenitors:
* Matthew D'Alonzo
* Gabe King
* Jeff Klouda
* Calvin Walker

##### Branches (see branches.md for more info):
* develop `default`: in progress changes, not necessarily ready for production. when a user is adding a feature or fixing a bug, a branch is made based on this develop branch, then merged back here and tested appropriately

* master: final versions of each iteration, should be ready for production at any time. merged (exclusively) from develop periodically when everything works
